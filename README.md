## Plugin Description

The html-keynbutton-response plugin displays HTML content as html-keyboard-response plugin. And records responses generated with the keyboard or click button. The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant does not respond within a fixed length of time.

## Development

1. Clone this repo and set as working path.
2. Run `npm install` to install required packages.
3. Run `npm run build --watch` to render the distribution.
4. Open one of the example html to show the basic function.

### Codespace dev

If you are in the codespace enviroment, please execute two additional processes:

1. install live-server by `npm install -g live-server`.
2. run `live-server`.
3. Open the popup windows and open the example html.

## Examples

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.
Double-click on an example HTML file to run it in your web browser, and open it with a programming-friendly text editor to see how it works.
